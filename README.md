USB - Mouse jiggler to knock out screen-saver

Uses a [digispark microcontroller](http://digistump.com/products/1).
The Digispark is an Attiny85 based microcontroller development board similar to the Arduino line, only cheaper, smaller, and a bit less powerful.

The small electronic box is a variation of 'Customizable Enclosure' by CanisVolans on Thingiverse: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1989417](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1989417).
